PACKAGE

package workers
    import "workers"

    The workers package allows launching a function as many goroutines and
    keeping those in separate threads. Given a CPU intensive worker like
    function it would be good to have many workers concurrently processing
    without having each other competing for the same resources. Basically,
    having one worker goroutine per CPU and each goroutine in a separate
    thread would do it.

FUNCTIONS

func Distribute(num_threads int, wg *sync.WaitGroup, worker func())
    Distribute worker into `num_threads` goroutines in separate threads. All
    new goroutines will belong to a the waitgroup

func Fill(worker func()) *sync.WaitGroup
    Fill will spawn as many worker goroutines as GOMAXPROCS and keep them in
    different threads
